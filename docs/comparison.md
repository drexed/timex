# Comparison

Picking a timeout story is less scary when you line the options up next
to each other. This page is a cheat sheet: stdlib `Timeout`, common
async timeouts, and TIMEx—without pretending they are the same tool.

## At a glance

| Concern | ⏱️ stdlib `Timeout` | ⚡ `Async::Task#with_timeout` | ⏰ TIMEx |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🧭 Default strategy | Async exception (`Thread#raise`) | Fiber-scheduler aware | Cooperative checkpoint |
| 🛡️ Safe for shared state | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (inside the fiber model) | ✅ Yes |
| 🖥️ Interrupts CPU-bound work | ⚠️ Yes (risky) | ❌ No | 🔧 Opt-in (`auto_check`, `Subprocess`, …) |
| 💿 Interrupts blocking IO | ✅ Yes (often) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (`IO` strategy) |
| 🔌 Per-syscall IO timeouts | ❌ No | 🔧 Indirect | ✅ Yes (`IO.read` / `write` / `connect`) |
| 🌐 Cross-host propagation | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ `X-TIMEx-Deadline` header |
| 🧩 Pluggable strategies | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Registry + companion gems |
| 📊 Telemetry | ❌ No | 🔧 Some | ✅ Active Support / OpenTelemetry / Logger / Null |
| ⏳ Grace + escalation | ❌ No | 🔧 Manual | ✅ `TwoPhase` composer |
| 🎯 Hedged execution | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ `Hedged` composer |
| 📈 Adaptive timeout | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ `Adaptive` composer |

!!! warning "Native timeouts beat *all* of these"

    Before stdlib `Timeout`, `Async`, **or** TIMEx, set the timeout your client
    already ships with — `Net::HTTP#read_timeout`, `redis-rb` `:read_timeout`,
    `pg` `statement_timeout`, gRPC per-call `deadline:`, etc. Those run inside
    the driver and actually stop the IO. Use TIMEx to coordinate a *budget
    across* those native timeouts, not to replace them.

## When stdlib is still fine

- Throwaway scripts where “good enough” beats “provably safe”.
- A single block of pure Ruby you have read end-to-end and you accept
  async interruption there.
- Places you have already audited for mutexes, half-written buffers,
  and `rescue Exception` swallowing timeouts.

## When TIMEx is the happier path

- Library code that should be safe for strangers to call.
- Multi-tier systems where one budget should flow through the whole
  tree.
- Work stuck in C extensions that ignore Ruby interrupts.
- Teams whose current plan B is “kill the worker and hope”.
