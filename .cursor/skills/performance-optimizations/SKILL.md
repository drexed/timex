# Performance Optimization

## Prerequisites

Ensure these tools are available before profiling:

```bash
gem install benchmark-ips memory_profiler ruby-prof
```

## Procedures

**Step 0: Baseline from Siblings**

Inspect **similar code paths** in the repo (e.g. another task class, context builder, or runtime hook) and compare allocation/query patterns. This keeps recommendations aligned with how the rest of TIMEx solves the same class of problem and avoids introducing an inconsistent optimization style.

**Step 1: Establish a Baseline**

1. Run `ruby scripts/ips-benchmark.rb` for iterations/second across all scenarios, context construction, and access patterns.
2. Run `ruby scripts/memory-profile.rb [scenario]` for per-file/per-line allocation and retained memory report.
3. Run `ruby scripts/allocation-trace.rb` for per-class allocation counts filtered to TIMEx source.
4. Run `ruby scripts/yjit-compare.rb` to measure YJIT speedup delta.
5. Save all outputs to a scratch file for before/after comparison.

All script paths are relative to `.cursor/skills/performance-optimizations/`.

**Step 2: Identify the Bottleneck**

Classify the bottleneck:
  - **CPU-bound** (deep call stacks, slow methods) → focus on algorithmic changes, memoization, or YJIT-friendly patterns.
  - **Allocation-bound** (high GC pressure, many short-lived objects) → focus on object reuse, frozen constants, and avoiding intermediate collections.

Prioritize bottlenecks by **impact × frequency** — a method adding 0.1ms overhead called 1000× per execution outranks a 5ms method called once.

**Step 3: Classify and Apply the Optimization**

Determine which category the fix falls into — prefer low-risk categories first:

| Category | Risk | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Allocation reduction** | Low | Frozen strings, `map!` vs `map`, reuse buffers, `EMPTY_HASH`/`EMPTY_ARRAY` |
| **Algorithmic** | Medium | Hash lookup vs linear scan, early returns, `catch`/`throw` vs exceptions |
| **Concurrency** | High | Thread-safe memoization, parallel task execution |
| **Architectural** | High | Structural change to context/runtime data flow |

Then follow these rules in priority order:

1. **Reuse frozen constants** — use `EMPTY_HASH`, `EMPTY_ARRAY`, `EMPTY_STRING` instead of allocating literals in hot paths. These are defined in `lib/timex.rb`.
2. **Memoize expensive computations** — use `@foo ||=` for values computed more than once per instance lifetime.
3. **Use `catch`/`throw` for flow control** — this is already the pattern in `Runtime`; never replace it with exceptions for non-error control flow since `throw` is ~10x faster than `raise`.
4. **Estimate impact** before committing — e.g. "reduces allocations ~60%", "eliminates O(n²) lookup". Avoid fake precision; order-of-magnitude or directional estimates are fine.
5. Keep the optimization **isolated** — do not mix performance changes with feature changes in the same commit.

**Step 4: Validate the Change**

1. Re-run `ruby scripts/ips-benchmark.rb` and compare iterations/second against the baseline.
2. Re-run `ruby scripts/memory-profile.rb` and confirm allocated memory/objects decreased (or stayed flat).
3. Re-run `ruby scripts/allocation-trace.rb` and confirm allocation counts decreased (or stayed flat).
4. Run `bundle exec rspec .` to ensure no regressions.
5. Run `bundle exec rubocop .` to ensure style compliance (rubocop-performance cops are active).
6. Verify no regressions in other metrics (e.g. fixing memory shouldn't degrade latency).

**Step 5: Guard Against Regression**

1. Add a spec or benchmark that exercises the optimized path if the bottleneck was severe.
2. Consider **performance budgets** for hot paths — e.g. max allocation count or IPS floor that CI can enforce.
3. If improvement is <5%, reconsider whether the change is worth the added complexity.

**Step 6: Document the Change**

1. Add a `## Performance` entry to `CHANGELOG.md` noting the before/after numbers.
2. If a new frozen constant or memoized value was introduced, add a brief YARD comment explaining the trade-off.

## General Principles

**Measure, don't guess.** Profiling data drives every decision. Intuition about performance is wrong more often than right.

**Optimize the hot path.** Code that runs once during boot doesn't matter. Code in a per-task or per-context-access loop does.

**Reduce allocations before reducing instructions.** In Ruby, GC pressure from object churn often dominates CPU time. Fewer allocations → fewer GC pauses → lower p99 latency.

**Fail fast.** Guard clauses and early returns prevent wasted work. Check the cheapest condition first.

**Prefer lazy over eager (for large datasets).** Use lazy enumerators and streaming when processing unbounded collections.

**Avoid work entirely.** The fastest code is code that doesn't run. Conditional execution and `skip!` guards eliminate unnecessary computation.

**Cache computed results.** If the same computation runs repeatedly with the same inputs, memoize it. Prefer instance-level `@foo ||=` → class-level constant → external cache.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Optimizing without profiling | Wastes time on non-bottlenecks | Profile first, always |
| Micro-optimizing cold paths | No measurable user impact | Focus on hot paths only |
| String concatenation in loops | Creates intermediate string objects | Use `String#<<`, `Array#join`, or `StringIO` |
| Nested loops over collections | O(n²) or worse | Hash lookup, precompute, or restructure |
| Unbounded in-memory collections | RSS spikes, OOM risk, GC stalls | Lazy enumerators, streaming |
| Over-memoizing | Holds references, prevents GC | Memoize only expensive computations |

## Key Patterns

### Frozen Constant Reuse

```ruby
# lib/timex.rb already defines these — use them as defaults
EMPTY_ARRAY  = [].freeze
EMPTY_HASH   = {}.freeze
EMPTY_STRING = ""
```

## YJIT Considerations

- Keep methods short and monomorphic — YJIT inlines small methods aggressively.
- Avoid `method_missing` fan-out on the critical path; YJIT cannot optimize dynamic dispatch.
- `freeze` on value objects helps YJIT prove immutability and skip write barriers.
- Run benchmarks with and without YJIT to measure the delta; report both numbers.

## Scripts Reference

| Script | Gem Dependency | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `scripts/ips-benchmark.rb` | `benchmark-ips` | IPS across execution scenarios, context construction, and access patterns with `compare!` |
| `scripts/memory-profile.rb` | `memory_profiler` | Per-file/per-line allocated and retained memory; accepts scenario arg |
| `scripts/allocation-trace.rb` | stdlib (`objspace`) | Per-class allocation counts via ObjectSpace tracing filtered to TIMEx |
| `scripts/yjit-compare.rb` | `benchmark-ips` | Side-by-side YJIT on/off runs with speedup ratios (Ruby 3.3+) |

The project also ships `bin/benchmark` (basic IPS) and `bin/profile` (ruby-prof call graph).

## Final Validation

Cross-reference the completed optimization against `references/checklist.md`.

## Error Handling

- If any script fails with `LoadError`, install the missing gem: `gem install benchmark-ips memory_profiler ruby-prof`.
- If `scripts/allocation-trace.rb` reports `0` allocations, the test helpers may be out of sync with the current codebase. Verify `spec/support/helpers/task_builders.rb` defines the referenced builder methods.
- If `scripts/yjit-compare.rb` aborts with "YJIT not available", ensure CRuby 3.1+ built with `--enable-yjit`. Runtime enable requires Ruby 3.3+.
- If benchmark numbers are noisy (>10% variance between runs), increase warmup time or close background processes.
- If profiling shows no clear bottleneck, check whether the system is I/O-bound — external service latency, file reads, or network round trips.
- If an optimization introduces test failures, it changed behavior — revert and re-profile.
- If memory improves but latency worsens (or vice versa), evaluate whether the trade-off is acceptable for the workload.
