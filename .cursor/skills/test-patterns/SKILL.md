# Test Patterns

> **Scope check:** Confirm what is being tested (task, workflow, context, configuration, or module) and whether the spec is unit or integration before writing code.

> **Bug-first rule:** If you discover a bug in the source code while writing or debugging a spec, ask the user whether they want to fix the bug before proceeding. Never silently work around a bug in the test (e.g. adjusting expectations to match broken behavior, skipping a scenario, or adding setup that compensates for the defect).

## Prerequisites

Ensure the test suite and linter pass before making changes:

```bash
bundle exec rspec .
bundle exec rubocop .
```

## Procedures

**Step 1: Classify the Spec**

Determine the spec type based on what is under test:

| Type | Directory | `RSpec.describe` target | Metadata |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | `spec/timex/` | Constant (`TIMEx::Context`) | none |
| **Module** | `spec/` | Constant (`TIMEx`) | none |
| **Integration** | `spec/integration/<area>/` | String (`"Task execution"`) | `type: :feature` |

Place the file in the matching directory. Mirror the `lib/` path for unit specs (e.g., `lib/timex/context.rb` → `spec/timex/context_spec.rb`). Group integration specs by area: `tasks/`, `workflows/`.

After classifying, scan 1–2 existing specs in the same directory. Mirror their `describe`/`context` structure, matchers, and setup style so the new spec reads like a sibling.

**Step 2: Scaffold the Spec File**

Read `assets/spec-template.md` and use the appropriate template (unit or integration) as the starting point.

Every spec file must:
1. Start with `# frozen_string_literal: true`
2. Require `"spec_helper"` (never `rails_helper`)
3. Use `RSpec.describe` at the top level — no `module` wrappers
4. Use `expect` syntax exclusively — never `should`

**Step 3: Structure the Spec**

Follow these nesting conventions:

1. **Top-level `describe`** — the class/module or feature string.
2. **Method-level `describe`** — use `".method_name"` for class methods, `"#method_name"` for instance methods. Skip for integration specs.
3. **`context` blocks** — group by conditions using `"when ..."` or `"with ..."` prefixes. Nest deeply when exercising multiple dimensions (execution mode × task outcome).
4. **`it` blocks** — one behavior per example, but multiple assertions are encouraged via global `aggregate_failures`.

Naming rules:
- `describe` takes a string or constant — never both.
- `context` always starts with `"when"`, `"with"`, or `"without"`.
- `it` descriptions state the expected outcome, not the setup. A failing spec name should explain *what broke* without reading the source.
- Use `described_class` to reference the class under test inside examples — never hardcode the constant.

**Step 4: Set Up Test Data**

Use the project's builder helpers — never FactoryBot, Fabrication, or bare `double`.

| Builder | Returns | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `create_task_class(base:, name:, &block)` | Anonymous task class | Custom `work` logic |
| `create_successful_task` | Task that appends `:success` | Happy-path execution |
| `create_skipping_task(reason:, **metadata)` | Task that calls `skip!` | Skip flow |
| `create_failing_task(reason:, **metadata)` | Task that calls `fail!` | Failure flow |
| `create_erroring_task(reason:)` | Task that raises `TIMEx::TestError` | Exception handling |
| `create_nested_task(strategy:, status:)` | Outer→Middle→Inner chain | Nested execution with `:swallow`, `:throw`, or `:raise` |
| `create_workflow_class(base:, name:, &block)` | Workflow class with `TIMEx::Workflow` | Workflow composition |
| `create_successful_workflow` | Workflow with mixed tasks | Workflow happy path |
| `create_skipping_workflow` | Workflow with a skipping inner task | Workflow skip flow |
| `create_failing_workflow` | Workflow with a failing inner task | Workflow failure flow |
| `create_erroring_workflow` | Workflow with an erroring inner task | Workflow error flow |

Guidelines:
- Prefer `let(:task)` / `let(:workflow)` for the object under test.
- Use `subject(:result)` for the execution result when the entire example group tests one call.
- Pass blocks to builders for inline DSL (`settings`, `task`, `tasks`, custom methods).
- Prefer real objects over mocks. Use stubs only to return predefined values when isolating a unit; avoid over-mocking. Use `instance_double` only when necessary; never `double`.

**Step 5: Write Assertions**

Follow these matcher conventions:

| Scenario | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Result state/status | `have_attributes(state: TIMEx::Signal::COMPLETE, status: TIMEx::Signal::SUCCESS, ...)` |
| Context values | `expect(result.context).to have_attributes(executed: %i[...])` or `be_empty` |
| Exception raising | `expect { result }.to raise_error(TIMEx::FailFault, "message")` |
| Block yielding | `expect { \|b\| described_class.configure(&b) }.to yield_with_args(TIMEx::Configuration)` |
| Collection contents | `contain_exactly(...)` for unordered, `eq([...])` for ordered |
| Identity | `be(object)` for same object, `eq(value)` for equality |
| Type | `be_a(TIMEx::Configuration)` |
| Boolean predicate | `be(true)` / `be(false)` — not `be_truthy`/`be_falsy` |
| Nested hash matching | `hash_including(key: value)` |
| String prefix | `start_with("OuterTask")` |

Coverage:
- Cover both typical cases and edge cases — invalid inputs, error conditions, nil, empty, frozen, and boundary values.
- Integration expectations should be realistic — test the API how it would actually be used, not contrived scenarios.
- When touching an existing spec file, update pre-existing examples to match current conventions.

What NOT to test:
- Declarative configuration (e.g., `settings` DSL output that just stores values).
- Obvious reflective expectations (e.g., "it returns what was passed in" for trivial getters).
- Constants, enum lists, or attribute declarations — test *behavior* callers rely on, not structure.

**Step 6: Handle Setup and Teardown**

- Use `let` / `let!` for test data. Prefer lazy `let` unless eagerness is required. Avoid instance variables.
- Use `before` / `after` for state mutation (e.g., `TIMEx.reset_configuration!`).
- Use `subject(:name)` when the return value of the call is the focus of the group.
- Never rely on example ordering — specs run in `--order random`.
- No cross-example shared mutable state — avoid class variables, global mutation, or leaked state that causes order-dependent failures. Each example must be independent.

**Step 7: Verify**

1. Run the full suite: `bundle exec rspec .`
2. Run the linter: `bundle exec rubocop .`
3. Confirm new specs are picked up (check file naming ends in `_spec.rb`).
4. Confirm no commented-out code or debug output (`pp`, `puts`, `binding.break`).

Cross-reference the completed spec against `references/checklist.md`.

## Spec Placement Decision Tree

1. **Does it test a single class/module's public API in isolation?**
   - Yes → `spec/timex/<class_name>_spec.rb` (unit)
   - No → Go to 2.
2. **Does it test execution flow across tasks or workflows?**
   - Yes → `spec/integration/<area>/` with `type: :feature`
   - No → Go to 3.
3. **Does it test the top-level `TIMEx` module?**
   - Yes → `spec/timex_spec.rb`
   - No → Ask the user for clarification.

## Existing Patterns Quick Reference

| Pattern | Where Used | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Result attribute assertion | Task execution specs | `have_attributes(state:, status:, reason:, metadata:, cause:)` |
| Context emptiness check | Skip/fail specs | `expect(result.context).to be_empty` |
| Nested propagation strategies | Task execution specs | `create_nested_task(strategy: :throw, status: :failure)` |
| Workflow conditional | Workflow conditionals spec | `task task1, if: :method?` / `if: proc { ... }` / `unless:` |
| Workflow breakpoints | Workflow breakpoints spec | `settings(workflow_breakpoints: %w[skipped failed])` |
| Group-level breakpoints | Workflow breakpoints spec | `tasks t1, t2, breakpoints: []` |
| Bang vs non-bang execution | Workflow/task execution specs | `execute` returns result, `execute!` raises `TIMEx::FailFault` |
| Instance-level execution | Task/workflow specs that pre-build the instance | `task = klass.new(ctx); task.execute` (or `task.execute(strict: true)` to raise) |
| Configuration reset | `timex_spec.rb` | `after { described_class.reset_configuration! }` |
| Runtime context mutation | Conditionals spec | Setup task writes to context, later task reads via `if: proc` |

## Error Handling

- If `bundle exec rspec .` shows failures unrelated to the new spec, investigate before proceeding — the suite should be green before and after.
- If RuboCop flags `RSpec/` cop violations, fix them inline. Common ones: `RSpec/NestedGroups` (max depth), `RSpec/MultipleExpectations` (not an issue — `aggregate_failures` is global), `RSpec/ExampleLength`.
- If a builder doesn't exist for the needed test scenario, extend the builder module in `spec/support/helpers/` following the existing naming pattern rather than creating a one-off helper.
